# Asteroid Classification
This repository consists in the application of machine learning models and algorithms related to supervised learning.

# Features

- Used the NASA Asteroids dataset to predict whether an asteroid is potentially hazardous;
- Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and normalization to handle missing and inconsistent values;
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and feature importance;
- Implemented and compared multiple supervised learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM);
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model validation and generalization testing;
- Tuned model parameters to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting;
- Evaluated models using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score;
- Visualized results through confusion matrices and performance comparison charts;
- Drew conclusions on the most effective algorithm for asteroid hazard prediction.
